\begin{abstract}

This thesis uses a variant of the classic stochastic multi-armed bandit framework to improve the  user experience in an anonymous chat application online by selecting good conversation starters. While the traditional algorithm would converge on the "optimal" conversation starter and use it for every conversation, this novel version of the algorithm attempts to provide new conversation starters for each user while still attempting to maximize the conversation quality. This thesis examines the empirical behavior of such an algorithm in a web application deployed at Princeton University.

\chapter{Introduction}

At most college campuses, as students become more settled within their college community, it becomes increasingly harder to branch out and meet people outside their immediate social graph. It was in response to such a problem that Tigers Anonymous (TA) was created. By providing a way to anonymously be matched with, chat with, and potentially meet fellow classmates, TA allows students to make new connections and shake up their social network while also providing a great way to develop and test a new variant of the classic UCB1 stochastic multi-armed bandit algorithm (the UCB1-AKSB algorithm, described fully in Chapter \ref{Methods}), which is the main focus on this thesis.

\section{What is Tigers Anonymous?}

Tigers Anonymous (TA) is the title of a chat application that allows any Princeton student to be matched with another Princeton student. After being matched, the students will be taken to an anonymous chatroom where they are given a conversation starter and have the opportunity to have a conversation. Once both participants have exchanged a pre-determined number of messages, a drop-down menu appears containing two choices (see Figure \ref{fig:DropDownMenu} below). If both users click "Yes", the application will authenticate both users via Facebook and reveal each users' identities to the other to facilitate communication outside of TA. For more information on how TA is implemented, see Appendices \ref{AppendixTABackendImplementation} and \ref{AppendixTAFrontendImplementation}.

\end{figure}

\section{Why Multi-Armed Bandits?}
A significant part of the functionality of TA is providing a conversation starter to reduce the awkwardness of the initial interaction with an anonymous stranger online. A naive approach would simply choose conversation starters at random, but this approach would be less than optimal for two reasons. First, users could potentially see the same conversation starter more than once in a short period of time, which would defeat the purpose of having novel conversation starters. Second, students might respond better to some conversation starters than others, so TA should be able to hone in on the best conversation starters and display them in order to facilitate higher quality conversations.

This is where the multi-armed bandit problem comes in. By modeling conversation starters as "arms" in a classical multi-armed bandit problem and a "success" as a "high-quality" conversation, it should be possible to solve both of the above problems. For more information on the multi-armed bandit problem and the motivation for the UCB1-AKSB algorithm described in Chapter \ref{Methods}, see Chapter \ref{LiteratureReview}.

\section{Assumptions}

In order to use a variant of the stochastic multi-armed bandit problem, I make the following assumptions about Princeton students: 

BLAH ADD MORE?

\begin{itemize}
\item Princeton students respond similarly to conversation prompts
\item The distribution of Facebook connects done by Princeton students is I.I.D
\end{itemize}

\section{UCB1-AKSB Algorithm}

The multi-armed bandit algorithm used by Tigers Anonymous is a novel variant of the well-known UCB1 algorithm \citep{auer02}. The new algorithm is outlined below:

Before explaining the algorithm, it will be useful to introduce notation. Let the users be represented as the set $U$ and the bandit arms as the set $X$. Let the set of arms that have already been played for user $u\in{U}$ be represented by the set $X^u \subset{X}$. The goal of the UCB1-AKSB algorithm is to pick some arm $x\in{X}$ given the pair of users $u,v \in{U}$. In this specific application, the goal is to pick the optimal conversation starter $x\in{X}$.

The UCB1-AKSB algorithm proceeds as follows: For each pair of users $u,v\in{U}$, we pick the conversation starter $x$ such that

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:UCBMain}
x = \underset{x \in{(X^u \cup X^v)}^{\mathsf{c}}}{\argmax{}} f(x)
\end{equation}
where

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:UCBMetric}
   f(x) = \left\{
     \begin{array}{lr}
       \bar{x}+ \sqrt{\frac{2\ln{n}}{n_x}} & : n_x > 0\\
       \infty & : n_x = 0
     \end{array}
   \right.
\end{equation}

In equation \eqref{eq:UCBMetric}, $n_x$ is the number of times that conversation starter $x$ has been played and $n$ is the total number of conversation starters that have been shown. Note that ties are broken arbitrarily.

\section{Tigers Anonymous Data Collection Methods}

The complete data-collection method used for this thesis is outlined below: 

\begin{enumerate}
\item Two users visit www.tigersanonymous.com/chat from a Princeton IP address.
\item The users are directed to the chat server and are matched on a first-come, first-served basis.
\item A conversation starter is selected based on the UCB1-AKSB algorithm described above.
\item After either of the users disconnects, a 10-tuple representing the chat session is logged in a database (see Data Format section below for more details).
\end{enumerate}

\section{Tigers Anonymous Data Format}

The data that will be collected can be represented by the vector of 10-tuples $(x_i, y_i, t0_i, t1_i, q_i, b_i, c1_i, c2_i, m1_i, m2_i)$ where $x_i$ and $y_i$ represent the pseudonymous user ids of the two participants in the chat, $t0_i$ and $t1_i$ represent the start and end times of the conversation, $q_i$ represents the conversation starter, $b_i \in {(0, 1)}$ represents whether the drop-down menu was displayed (i.e. both chat participants exchanged more than a predefined number of messages), $c1_i, c2_i \in{(0, 1)}$ represent whether users $x_i$ and $y_i$ opted to de-anonymize the conversation respectively and $m1_i, m2_i \in{(0,1)}$ represent the number of messages that user $x_i$ and $y_i$ sent respectively. The subscript $i$ is unique for each conversation. 

A sample of this data is shown below:

\chapter{Data Analysis}

\section{Regret Analysis}

Recall from Chapter \ref{LiteratureReview} that the cumulative regret of the UCB1 algorithm is proportional to log($n$), where $n$ is the number of plays. Thus, we should expect the UCB1-AKSB algorithm to also provide a cumulative regret function that looks approximately logarithmic in the number of plays. This regret, $R(n)$, was calculated using equation \eqref{eq:RegretComputation} below under the assumptions that the long-term average de-anonymization proportion was optimal and that each conversation starter had an I.I.D distribution of de-anonymizations (i.e. successes). 

\begin{equation}
\label{eq:RegretComputation}
R(n) = \mu^{*}n - \sum_{x \in X}{W_n(x)}
\end{equation}

In equation \eqref{eq:RegretComputation}, $R(n)$ is the cumulative regret after the UCB1-AKSB algorithm has run $n$ times, $\mu^{*}$ is the long-term average proportion of conversation de-anonymizations, and $W_n(x)$ is the number of de-anonymizations that resulted after arm $x \in X$ was played. The result, $R(n)$, of the UCB1-AKSB algorithm is shown below in \ref{fig:TADe-AnonymizationRegret}.

\begin{figure}[H]
\centering
\includegraphics[trim= 0mm 0mm 0mm 0mm, clip, scale=0.5]{./Pictures/TADe-AnonymizationRegret.jpg}
\caption{TA De-Anonymization Regret Analysis}
\label{fig:TADe-AnonymizationRegret}
\end{figure}

The regret looks approximately logarithmic for the second half of the dataset, but the first half of the data gives a steadily negative cumulative regret. This is due to the fact that the I.I.D assumption of conversation de-anonymization is most-likely false. Instead, there were probably different regimes in which people perceived Facebook de-anonymization differently. This is most analogous to the Markovian bandits in \citet{bubeck12}, where each conversation starter (i.e. bandit arm) is associated with a Markov process with a discrete set of distributions.
Because of the clear split in the data, it seems like there were two discrete distributions from which de-anonymizations were drawn. The first distribution occurred in the initial stages of TA's launch, where users were more likely to de-anonymize a conversation simply because of the novelty of doing so. This is supported by looking at the initial cumulative Facebook de-anonymization statistics (see \ref{fig:TADe-AnonymizationCumulative}), where the Facebook connect rate was almost double the long-term average. The second distribution most likely occurred as users became more used to the idea of Facebook de-anonymization, the rate of de-anonymization drifted slowly back towards the long term average (around the second half of the data set). The existence of multiple regimes explains the two polar opposite segments of regret data.

\section{UCB1-AKSB Algorithm Efficacy}

Since the original goal of the UCB1-AKSB algorithm was to improve conversation quality (for which conversation de-anonymization served as a proxy), the efficacy of this algorithm will be assessed by the long-term proportion of conversation de-anonymization. FIXME DAILY GRAPH AND REFERENCE CUMULATIVE GRAPH 

In addition to using conversation de-anonymization as a metric of success, it makes sense to use other proxies for conversation quality (such as participation rates and average conversation length), because they are more fine-grained than the binary variable of conversation de-anonymization. The plots are below.

\section{Summary of Findings}



\section{Potential Applications}

A weakly contextual bandit that requires less computation
Could be used for recommendation algorithms that need to recommend newly generated content (such as blog posts, news websites, etc.)

\section{Further Improvements}

The methodology of this study could be improved by increasing the user space

For a fixed arm space (i.e. Tigers Anonymous conversation starters), a possible improvement to the UCB1-AKSB algorithm would be to have a moving time-window, so that both users would be guaranteed to see a conversation starter that they haven't seen in at least 5 uses or 5 days (i.e. number of uses or a fixed time length)
