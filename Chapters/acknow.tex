First and foremost, I would like to thank my parents and sister for years of love and support as I conclude my undergraduate education. I am the person that I am today because of them, and I am very proud to call them my family.

I am also grateful to Professor Bubeck for his guidance over the course of my senior year. His flexibility made this relatively un-orthodox ORFE thesis extremely enjoyable, and allowed me to spend my senior year getting excited about building something new. I am also grateful to my friends Zachary Garcia '14 and Damjan Kora\'{c} '13 for giving excellent feedback on the first draft.

This thesis also wouldn't have been possible without the help of Daniel Kang '14, with whom I collaborated on the auxiliary, non-bandit related code in this thesis. His experience in web design and front-end development was indispensable in getting Tigers Anonymous up and running in such a short time, and his friendship made the collaboration that much more enjoyable.

Finally, I'd like to thank my wonderful girlfriend Isabella Chen '15 for being there for me throughout the course of this year. Through thick and thin, I knew she would always have my back.
