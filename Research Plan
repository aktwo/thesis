      o user waiting
      o user connect
      o user chat
      o user fb match

Perform data analysis
  - Finalize ubigraph recording to play in presentation
  - Make 2D graph representation of first and second batch of users
  - Plot cumulative regret and cumulative regret per turns played to see if there's any convergence
    X generate time series for both facebook chats and immediate disconnects
    o plot results
  - Give conditional probabilities for chat attributes over time (i.e. on a per-user basis, did we see any improvement in chat attributes):
    o do this for matching and number of chat messages exchanged

Conclusions:
  - The point of this paper is to empirically analyze a variant of UCB to see how it works, if it is successful, it could be applied in a variety of areas: news article recommendation, etc. etc. and it's much easier to do than a contextual bandit (i.e. less computational overhead)
  - Explanations for not working: people ignore the conversation starter


Future ideas
  - Add moving time window to "seen" questions to allow the algorithm to work continuously
  - Give a more finely tuned score based on a few criteria (i.e. give 0 for immediate disconnect, 0.3 for small convo, 0.7 for large convo and 1 for match)
